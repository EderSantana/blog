    "... The most interesting thing here was how they handled differently sized samples (as of now, I haven't read \"Memory Networks\" yet). Note that for fact reasoning we may have different numbers of facts, each one as a sentence of arbitrary size. They handled that by cascading DNNs, RNNs and/or pooling operations to end up with a fixed size vector that could be utlimately classified or used as a seed to a final sequence generator RNN. The stack also does \"sensor fusion\" between query and facts at each level."
